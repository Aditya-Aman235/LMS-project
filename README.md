# LMS-project
<p>This is a simple LMS project which i have created during a workshop.<br>
This backend project is build using Django framework and REST APIs <br>
In this LMS app there are two personas one is teacher and the other is student.<br>
This is a very basic project, here we have created serializers through which <br>
we can register as a teacher or student.<br>
Here we have an app called courses in which we have a file called models.py there <br>
we have defined our lmsUsers and then we have created a class called Course upload <br>
which is basically for teachers using which a teacher can upload there course.<br>
Here we can also add another class called courseEnroll through which a student can<br>
enroll in a course developed by a specific teacher.
