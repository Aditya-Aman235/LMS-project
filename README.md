# LMS-project
<p>This is a simple LMS project which i have created during a workshop.<br>
This backend project is build using Django framework and REST APIs <br>
In this LMS app there are two personas one is teacher and the other is student.<br>
This is a very basic project, here we have created serializers through which <br>
we can register as a teacher or student.<br>
And can fetch the data through http requests using postman software.
